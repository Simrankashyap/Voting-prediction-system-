# Voting-prediction-system-
One of the major applications of Data Science is "Forecasting" and that's what I've done in this project. 
In this system, I extracted data from different social media platforms like twitter and facebook and performed sentiment analysis to know the favors and against number of people or amount. By performing sentment analysis using R, it will be easy to predict who is going to win probably in the 2016 Elections between Hilary and Trump. 
How? 
The more negative/positive words about Hilary/Trump will help us in estimating the future with less accuracy though.
